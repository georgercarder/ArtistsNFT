# ArtistsNFT 

Artist friendly NFT that enforces payment of royalties on every transfer.
This differs from the current model, where whether royalties are respected
is a matter of the platform, or parties, respecting it.

`ArtistsNFT` allows the artist to declare a `minimumSalePrice` which must be met
on every transfer, from which a royalty is extracted.
